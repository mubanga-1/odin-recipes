            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>
                Heat oil in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat.
                Add ground beef and sausage and cook,
                crumbling with a wooden spoon until browned,
                5 to 7 minutes. Add jalapeno, onion, and garlic and cook,
                stirring often, until vegetables are softened, about 3 minutes.
                Add in pepperoni, tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, and water
                and stir until well combined. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
                Bring to a simmer,
                reduce heat and cook, uncovered,
                stirring occasionally while pasta is prepared.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
            </p>

            <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <p>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
                Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally,
                until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <p>
                Coat a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. 
                Spread a thin layer of sauce over the bottom of the prepared dish. 
                Top with a layer of lasagna noodles, 1/2 of ricotta, and 1/3 of mozzarella cheese.
                Sprinkle with 1/3 of grated Parmesan cheese and 1/3 of sauce mixture.
                Repeat that layer once more. Top with remaining sauce, mozzarella cheese, and Parmesan. 
            </p>

            <h4>Step 5</h4>
            <p>
                Bake in the preheated oven until browned around the edges and bubbly, about 40 minutes
